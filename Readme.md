# 🧠 Logic Bomb Detection using LNN (Logic Neural Network)

A research-based AI project that leverages **Logic Neural Networks (LNNs)** to detect and prevent **logic bomb attacks** in software systems.  
This project combines **logical reasoning** with **neural learning**, bridging the gap between symbolic AI and deep learning for cybersecurity applications.

## 🚀 Overview

**Logic bombs** are malicious code segments embedded within legitimate programs that trigger under specific conditions.  
Traditional malware detection systems often fail to identify them due to their **conditional and hidden nature**.

This project implements a **Logic Neural Network (LNN)** model that learns **logical rules** from code or behavioral data to detect anomalies indicative of logic bombs.

## 🧠 What is a Logic Neural Network (LNN)?

An **LNN** is a neural network that embeds **logical constraints** into its architecture.  
It ensures that the learned representations are **interpretable** and **rule-compliant**, unlike traditional black-box models.

For example:  
If a rule is `IF condition_A AND condition_B THEN safe_state`,  
an LNN ensures the neural outputs **respect** this logical structure while training.
